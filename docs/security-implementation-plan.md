# Security Implementation Plan

## 1. Created Security Policy
- [x] SECURITY.md established with:
  - Vulnerability reporting process
  - Security update procedures
  - Supported versions
  - Response timeline commitments
  - Disclosure policies

## 2. GitHub Security Workflows (To Be Implemented)
```yaml
# security.yml to be created with:
name: Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly runs

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install bandit safety
    
    - name: Run Bandit
      run: bandit -r ./ -f json -o bandit-results.json
    
    - name: Check dependencies
      run: safety check
    
    - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

## 3. Dependency Management (To Be Implemented)
```yaml
# dependabot.yml to be created with:
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Switch to Code mode
2. Create .github/workflows/security.yml
3. Create .github/dependabot.yml
4. Configure repository settings:
   - Enable dependency graph
   - Enable Dependabot alerts
   - Enable Dependabot security updates
   - Configure branch protection rules

## 5. Security Testing Plan
1. Verify workflow runs successfully:
   - Push a test commit
   - Monitor workflow execution
   - Review security scan results
2. Test vulnerability reporting process
3. Verify Dependabot functionality:
   - Check alert generation
   - Review update PRs
   - Validate version policies

## 6. Documentation Updates Needed
1. Update README.md with security badge
2. Add security considerations to Contributing Guide
3. Document security testing procedures
4. Create security incident response playbook

## Next Steps
1. Switch to Code mode to implement the workflows
2. Set up the repository security settings
3. Test the security measures
4. Update related documentation
