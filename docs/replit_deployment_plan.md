# Replit Deployment Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to deploy the LeetCode Analysis application on Replit.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Redis database
- Environment variables configuration
- Static file serving capability

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create New Replit Project**
   - Create a new Python Repl
   - Select Python as the language
   - Initialize with a basic Flask template

2. **Code Migration**
   - Upload/copy these essential files:
     - `api/app.py` (main application)
     - `api/templates/*` (HTML templates)
     - `api/static/*` (CSS/JS assets)
     - `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
     - `api/core/*` (core functionality)

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Add `.replit` configuration file:
     ```
     language = "python3"
     run = "python api/app.py"
     ```
   - Configure environment variables in Replit's Secrets tab:
     - Any API keys
     - Redis configuration
     - Flask configuration

4. **Redis Configuration**
   - Use Replit's built-in Redis database service
   - Update Redis connection settings in the application

5. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install required packages from requirements.txt
   - Note: Some packages may need version adjustments for Replit compatibility

6. **Static Files Configuration**
   - Ensure static files are served correctly from the Flask application
   - Verify CSS/JS assets are loading properly

7. **Application Launch**
   - Use Gunicorn as the WSGI server
   - Configure the application to run on Replit's assigned port

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Verification**
   - Test all routes and functionality
   - Verify Redis connection
   - Check static asset loading
   - Test API endpoints

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable caching where appropriate
   - Optimize static file serving
   - Monitor memory usage

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Set up basic logging
   - Monitor application performance
   - Track error rates

## Notes
- Replit's free tier has certain limitations on:
  - Memory usage
  - CPU usage
  - Storage space
  - Always-on capability
- Consider upgrading to Replit's paid tier for production deployments
