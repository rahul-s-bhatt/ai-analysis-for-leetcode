# AI-Driven Insights Using LeetCode API Data

## **1. Personalized Problem Recommendations**
### **How?**  
- Analyze solved problems (`get_user_skill_stats`) and submission history (`get_submission_details`).
- Identify weak areas based on failed attempts (`get_user_user_profile_user_question_progress_V2`).
- Use collaborative filtering (similar users' problem-solving patterns) to recommend problems.

### **Insights Provided:**  
- **Skill gaps**: "You struggle with Dynamic Programming; try these problems."
- **Next challenge**: "You solved all Easy problems; hereâ€™s your first Medium."

---

## **2. Performance Trend Analysis**
### **How?**  
- Track contest rankings (`get_user_contest_ranking`).
- Fetch problem-solving streaks (`get_user_profile_calendar`).
- Visualize progress over time with submission data (`get_submission_details`).

### **Insights Provided:**  
- **Progress Graph**: "Your ranking improved by 15% in the last 3 months."
- **Streak Alerts**: "You are on a 20-day solving streakâ€”keep it up!"
- **Regression Alerts**: "Your recent contest ratings dropped. Suggested areas to improve."

## **3. AI-Powered Mock Interview Readiness**
### **How?**  
- Use problem-solving stats (`get_user_difficulty_stats`).
- Analyze problem-solving time from contests (`get_user_contest_ranking`).
- Track company-tagged problems solved.

### **Insights Provided:**  
- **Readiness Score**: "Your problem-solving speed is in the top 30%â€”ready for interviews!"
- **Weak Topics**: "You need more practice in Graph problems."
- **Targeted Practice**: "Try Amazon-style problems based on your company preferences."

---

## **4. AI-Powered Peer Comparison**
### **How?**  
- Compare skill stats (`get_user_skill_stats`) with global averages.
- Rank user submissions (`get_user_contest_ranking`).

### **Insights Provided:**  
- **Competitive Edge**: "Your rating is higher than 80% of users."
- **Peer Benchmarking**: "People solving similar problems also solve these harder ones."

---

## **5. Optimal Learning Path Generation**
### **How?**  
- Use solved problem tags (`get_user_skill_stats`).
- Apply reinforcement learning to suggest a path based on past submissions.

### **Insights Provided:**  
- **Dynamic Roadmap**: "Start with Graphs, then move to DP problems."
- **Milestone Tracking**: "You've completed 50% of the roadmap!"

---

## **6. AI-Driven Code Efficiency Insights**
### **How?**  
- Extract runtime/memory from submissions (`get_submission_details`).
- Compare against problem averages.

### **Insights Provided:**  
- **Code Efficiency Score**: "Your solutions are 40% faster than average."
- **Optimization Suggestions**: "Your DP solution can be improved using Memoization."

---

## **7. Job-Specific Insights**
### **How?**  
- Analyze problems tagged by companies (`get_user_skill_stats`).
