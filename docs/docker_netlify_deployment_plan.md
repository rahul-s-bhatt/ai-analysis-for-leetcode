# Docker-based Netlify Deployment Plan

## Current Status
- Project has a Dockerfile configured for production deployment
- No existing Netlify configuration
- Application runs on port 8080 via gunicorn

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Netlify Configuration Setup
1. Create `netlify.toml` with Docker-specific settings:
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "docker build -t ai-leetcode-analyzer ."
     publish = "api"

   [build.environment]
     NETLIFY_USE_DOCKER = "true"

   [[plugins]]
     package = "@netlify/plugin-docker"
   ```

2. Install required Netlify build plugins:
   - @netlify/plugin-docker for Docker support

### 2. Docker Configuration Updates
1. Current Dockerfile is well-configured but needs these adjustments:
   - Add PORT environment variable support
   - Update healthcheck to use Netlify's expected port
   - Add Netlify-specific labels

2. Required Dockerfile modifications:
   ```dockerfile
   # Add Netlify-specific environment variable
   ENV PORT=8080

   # Update CMD to use PORT variable
   CMD ["sh", "-c", "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 --threads 2 --timeout 60 api.app:app"]
   ```

### 3. Netlify Deployment Settings
1. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
   - PYTHON_VERSION=3.9
   - NODE_VERSION=16
   - FLASK_ENV=production

2. Set up build hooks:
   - Pre-build: Docker layer caching
   - Post-build: Container health checks

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
1. Update GitHub Actions workflow to:
   - Build and test Docker image
   - Push to container registry (optional)
   - Trigger Netlify deployment

### 5. Testing Plan
1. Local testing:
   ```bash
   netlify dev --docker
   ```
2. Staging deployment testing:
   - Deploy to Netlify draft URL
   - Verify container health checks
   - Test application functionality

### 6. Production Deployment
1. Gradual rollout strategy:
   - Deploy to staging
   - Run smoke tests
   - Gradually shift traffic using Netlify's split testing

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Set up Docker-specific monitoring:
   - Container health metrics
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Log aggregation
2. Configure alerts for:
   - Container crashes
   - High resource usage
   - Failed health checks

## Timeline
- Initial setup and configuration: 1-2 days
- Testing and validation: 1-2 days
- Production deployment: 1 day
- Monitoring setup: 1 day

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Cold Starts**
   - Use container pre-warming strategies
   - Implement lazy loading where possible

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Monitor container resource usage
   - Optimize Docker image size
   - Use multi-stage builds

3. **Deployment Downtime**
   - Implement zero-downtime deployment
   - Use Netlify's atomic deployments

## Success Criteria
1. Successful Docker-based deployment on Netlify
2. Zero-downtime deployments
3. Container health checks passing
4. Application performance meeting or exceeding current metrics
5. Monitoring and alerting system operational

## Next Steps
1. Create netlify.toml
2. Update Dockerfile
3. Set up Netlify build plugins
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement monitoring
