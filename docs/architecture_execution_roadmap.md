## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Staged rollout with performance monitoring
   - Fallback: Ready-to-deploy rollback procedures

2. **Data Migration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing in staging
   - Fallback: Data backup and restore procedures

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Regular security scanning
   - Fallback: Emergency patching process

### Operational Risks
1. **Resource Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Clear prioritization
   - Fallback: Phase adjustments

2. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - Mitigation: Training sessions
   - Fallback: External consultant support

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Cache hit rate > 80%
- Error rate < 1%

### Security Metrics
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- 100% compliance with security policies
- < 5 minute incident response time

### Operational Metrics
- 99.9% system availability
- < 15 minute MTTR
- Zero data loss incidents

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Week 1)**
   - Schedule kickoff meeting
   - Set up project tracking
   - Begin team onboarding

2. **Technical Setup (Week 1-2)**
   - Set up development environments
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines
   - Establish monitoring baseline

3. **Initial Development (Week 3)**
   - Begin Phase 1 implementation
   - Start daily standups
   - Configure automated testing

## Review and Adjustment Process

### Weekly Reviews
