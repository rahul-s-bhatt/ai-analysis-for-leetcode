# ðŸ”´ Bug: Priority Areas Section Not Displaying Correctly

## Problem Description
The Priority Areas section of the analysis results is currently appearing empty due to several interconnected issues in the data processing pipeline.

### Current Behavior
- Priority Areas section shows no items
- Consistency metrics not calculating correctly 
- Data processing misalignment between GraphQL API and analytics system

### Expected Behavior
- Display at least one priority area for new users
- Show consistency warnings for users with <15 active days/month
- Display difficulty-based priorities for areas with <20% completion rate
- Provide actionable improvement suggestions

## Technical Details
The issue spans multiple system components:

1. **Data Retrieval (GQLQuery.py)**
   - Missing critical fields in GraphQL query:
     - userCalendar data (activeYears, streak, totalActiveDays)
     - submissionCalendar
     - dccBadges
     - submitStats with timestamp data

2. **Data Processing (data_formatter.py)**
   - Calendar data parsing issues
   - Submission data not properly structured

3. **Analytics System (pattern_analyzer.py, analytics_manager.py)**
   - Consistency metrics calculation errors
   - Priority detection logic misalignment
   - Incorrect data structure assumptions

4. **Frontend Display (results.html)**
   - Template not properly handling priority levels

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Retrieval
- Update GraphQL query structure in GQLQuery.py
- Add missing fields for user calendar and submission stats
- Include timestamp data for better tracking

### Phase 2: Data Processing
- Enhance data_formatter.py with proper calendar data parsing
- Implement structured submission data formatting
- Add error handling for missing data

### Phase 3: Analytics Updates
- Fix consistency calculation in pattern_analyzer.py
- Update priority detection logic in analytics_manager.py
- Implement proper data structure validation

### Phase 4: Frontend Display
- Update results.html template
- Add priority-based styling
- Implement proper error states

## Files Affected
- `/api/GQLQuery.py`
- `/api/data_formatter.py`
- `/api/core/analytics/pattern_analyzer.py`
- `/api/core/analytics/analytics_manager.py`
- `/api/templates/results.html`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Priority Areas section displays at least one item for new users
- [ ] Consistency priorities appear for users with <15 active days/month
- [ ] Problem-solving priorities show for difficulties with <20% completion rate
- [ ] Each priority includes clear reasoning and actionable suggestions
- [ ] All priority levels (high/medium/low) display with correct styling

## Testing Requirements
- Test with various user profiles:
  - New users
  - Users with low activity
  - Users with varied problem-solving patterns
  - Edge cases (no submissions, all problems solved)

## Labels
- `bug`
- `high-priority`
- `needs-testing`
- `analytics`
- `frontend`
