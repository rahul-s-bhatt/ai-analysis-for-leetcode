[DOCS] Enhance Setup Documentation with Troubleshooting Guide

## Feature Description
Create a comprehensive setup guide with troubleshooting steps to help new contributors get started quickly and resolve common setup issues.

## Problem Statement
While we have basic setup instructions, new contributors might face various environment-specific issues. A detailed troubleshooting guide will reduce setup friction and make the project more accessible.

## Proposed Solution
Create a detailed setup guide that includes:
1. Step-by-step installation instructions
2. Common issues and solutions
3. Environment-specific considerations
4. Development environment best practices

## Technical Details
The guide should be created in Markdown format and include:

1. **Environment Setup**
```markdown
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.5
- pip
- git
- (Optional) Docker

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-analysis-for-leetcode.git
   cd ai-analysis-for-leetcode
   ```

2. Create virtual environment
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # Unix/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
```

2. **Common Issues**
```markdown
### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Package Installation Errors
**Issue**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails
**Solutions**:
- Ensure Python 3.11.5 is installed
- Upgrade pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install wheel: `pip install wheel`

#### 2. Application Startup Issues
**Issue**: Flask application fails to start
**Solutions**:
- Check Python version compatibility
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure no other service is using port 5000
```
