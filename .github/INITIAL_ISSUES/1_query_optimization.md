[FEATURE] GraphQL Query Optimization and Batching

## Feature Description
Implement query batching and optimization for LeetCode API interactions to improve performance and reduce API calls.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the application makes multiple separate API calls for different data types, which can lead to performance issues and hit rate limits. We need to optimize these queries to provide a better user experience.

## Proposed Solution
Implement GraphQL query batching to combine multiple queries into single requests:
1. Combine profile, contest, and submission queries
2. Implement intelligent query structuring
3. Add error handling and retry logic

## Technical Details
Example of a batched query structure:
```graphql
query UserCompleteData($username: String!) {
  profile: matchedUser(username: $username) {
    # Profile data
  }
  contestData: userContestRanking(username: $username) {
    # Contest data
  }
  submissions: recentSubmissionList(username: $username) {
    # Submission data
  }
}
```
